# Simple Text-based Game

This is a simple text-based game created in Python. The player starts in a dark room with two doors, one to the left and one to the right. The player must choose a door, but each pathway has a 50/50 chance of leading to a pitfall. If the player chooses the path to the locked door room, they can take a key to unlock the door and find a hidden passage.

## How to Run the Game

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the game file (`simple_game.py`), and run the following command:


## How to Play

The game will prompt you to choose a door by typing "left" or "right". Make your choice and press Enter. If you chose the path to the locked door room, you will be asked if you want to take the key. Type "yes" or "no" and press Enter.

If you have the key and are in the locked door room, you can unlock the door and find a hidden passage. However, beware that each choice you make has a 50/50 chance of leading to a pitfall, which will end the game.

Good luck and have fun!
